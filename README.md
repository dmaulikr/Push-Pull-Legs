# Push-Pull-Legs

This is iOS app is designed using Swift and is supposed to be a personal fitness tracker for the workout program that I follow. It currently does not use AutoLayout so it is solely designed to be used on an iPhone 6/s Plus. Attempting use on any other screen size will distory the layout and make it unusable.
